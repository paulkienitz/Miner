# Miner

This is an Amiga implementation of the classic Windows game of Minesweeper which I coded decades ago.  The one significant difference is that, compared to the Windows game of the time, this lets you get faster scores because it actuates on the click of the mouse button instead of on release.  Also it has more sound and color.  See the file `Miner.doc` (which is a plain text file, not a Word document) for details.
