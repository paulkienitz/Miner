                                  MINER              (release 5)

One of the most popular games available under MicroSoft Windows is a little
hack called MineSweeper.  Numerous copies and imitations of that game exist,
including at least four for the Amiga.  I tried Minefield by David J.
Zechiel, Mineclearer by Kopetzky Theodorich, and WBMineSweeper by Marat
Fayzullin.  But in playing them, I was frustrated.  They all have annoying
shortcomings.  (And all three of these authors asked for money for their
games.)  Finally I couldn't stand it any more, and decided to write a DECENT
minesweeping game.  It's called Miner, and so naturally it's dedicated to Jay
Miner.  And it's free.  Miner release 5 is copyright © 1994, 1995 by Paul
Kienitz, and may be freely copied and distributed as long as none of the
included files are removed or altered.

After the first release of Miner, I ran across MineSweeper by John Matthews.
This is the fanciest of the other programs, but I still found it annoying or
frustrating in some ways.  Before reading its docs, I had not known about
some of the options available in Windows MineSweeper, and as a result I ended
up adding features to Miner for a second release.  These changes greatly
improve the ability to get good scores, and I think you'll find that Miner is
the "fastest" of the mine games -- the easiest to get impressive scores with,
while offering no play features not available in the others (no cheats).


	OVERVIEW:
	=========

The game is played on a rectangular grid of squares, each of which may or may
not have a mine hidden under it.  Your goal is to click the mouse on every
square that does NOT have a mine.  If you click on a mined square, you get
blown up and lose the game.  If you click on a safe square, a number appears
in it telling you how many -- but not which -- of the eight squares next to
the one you clicked on are mined.  This information can often tell you, if
you use logic, where other safe squares are.

Once you click on a square for the first time, a the clock starts counting
elapsed time.  To get a good score, you want to click on all the safe squares
on the board in as few seconds as possible.  The three best times for each
size of board are stored in a high scores list.

There are six board sizes available.  Like most minesweeping games, there are
three standard sizes called "Beginnner", "Intermediate", and "Expert".
Unlike any of the other games mentioned above, the board sizes used by Miner
match those with the same name in the original Windows MineSweeper game, so
you can compare your scores directly with those of people who play
MineSweeper under Windows.  They are:

    Beginner:      8 squares high and 8 squares wide, with 10 mines.
    Intermediate:  16 squares high and 16 squares wide, with 40 mines.
    Exert:         16 squares high and 30 squares wide, with 99 mines.

There are also three custom board sizes which you can adjust.  Many mine
games allow you to specify a custom size, but do not remember the size you
pick, or store high scores for it.  Miner remembers three different custom
sizes, and will keep track of high scores for each one, until you change its
parameters.  By default, the three custom boards start out as:

    Custom #1:  12 squares high and 12 squares wide, with 28 mines.
    Custom #2:  15 squares high and 20 squares wide, with 55 mines.
    Custom #3:  21 squares high and 30 squares wide, with 120 mines.

The default Custom #1 size matches the "Semiprofis" size used in Kopetzky
Theodorich's MineClearer.  The default Custom #3 size, 21 by 30, is the
largest board that can be displayed on a 640 by 200 screen.  If your Amiga's
display has more resolution, you can select sizes as large as will fit.  A
PAL system with overscan could have board sizes of 29 by 33 or even larger,
even without selecting a higher resolution screen mode.  If possible, the
board will be made of fairly large squares, roomy enough so that the numbers
inside them are very easily legible.  But with the larger board sizes such as
"Expert", this is not possible; it has to use somewhat smaller squares so
that everything can fit.

Miner can be run from CLI or Workbench, and in the former case it detaches
itself to run in the background automatically.  AmigaDOS 2.04 or higher is
required.  There are no startup arguments.  Unlike release 3 and older,
release 5 does not require an unusually large stack setting.

The first thing it does is read the file "Miner.scores", which it keeps in
the same directory the program itself is in (PROGDIR:).  This tells it not
just the current high score list, but the parameters of the three custom
boards, and what board size you were using the last time you ran the game,
and the custom screen mode you have selected, if any.  It will start with the
same size you had last played, when freshly started.  If there is no high
score file, it creates a beginner board.

Most of the screen is available for the board display.  If the board does not
fill this space, which it rarely does, it is centered.  On the left margin is
a display area containing two numbers displayed in large yellow numerals, and
three gadgets.  The upper number, labeled "Time", tells how many seconds have
elapsed since you began the game, and the lower one, labeled "Mines", tells
how many unlocated mines are in the board.  The three gadgets are "New",
"Pause", and "Quit".  The first one erases the board and makes a new one,
ready to begin a new game with.  The second is used only in the middle of a
game, and is ghosted at other times; it lets you temporarily stop in the
middle of a game.  The third causes Miner to exit immediately, writing out an
updated high scores file if any score or setting has been changed.


	MENUS:
	======

Most options are controlled with menus.  Since the right mouse button is used
in playing the game, the mouse pointer must be over some part of the screen
other than the board itself, to use the menus.  There are three menus: "Game",
"Board", and "Options".  The items in the "Game" menu are:

    "New game" -- like the "New" gadget, it creates a new board ready to play
    a fresh game on.  It can be used in mid-game to start over, or after a
    game has been completed.
       key shortcut "N"

    "Pause" -- again, just like the gadget.  Ghosted except when in mid-game.
    It causes the clock to stop, so that you can do something else until you
    want to finish the game.  It covers up the board with a big blue
    requester so that you can't cheat by studying it while the clock is
    stopped.  To resume the game, click the left mouse button anywhere on the
    screen, or press any key.
       key shortcut "P"

    "Best scores" -- displays the three best times that anyone has achieved
    for each of the six board sizes, and then waits for you to click the
    mouse to clear the display.  Each board size includes a notation of its
    parameters in a format like this: "(30 × 16, 99M)", where the first
    number is the board's width, the second is the height, and the third is
    the number of mines.
       key shortcut "S"

    "About" -- displays the name of the program and its author, and a summary
    of the object of the game.  If "About" or "Best scores" is used in the
    middle of a game, the clock will wait as with "Pause" for you to go back
    to the game by clicking the mouse or pressing a key.  "About" and "Best
    scores" both cover up the board just the way "Pause" does, only with
    different text.
       key shortcut "A"

    "Quit" -- like the gadget, exits the game immediately, updating the high
    scores file.
       key shortcut "Q"

There is a dividing line between "Best scores" and "About".  The "Board" menu
is used to select the size of board the game is played on -- it is explained
below.  The third menu, "Options", has these items:

    "Screen mode" -- opens the ASL screenmode requester, if you have AmigaDOS
    2.1 or newer.  (If you have 2.04, you can get a copy of asl.library from
    someone who has 2.1, and install it in place of the copy you have, and
    this feature will work.)  The requester lets you select PAL instead of
    NTSC or vice versa, select high resolution AGA display modes, or use
    interlaced modes.  Only high-res modes that support 8 colors are listed.
    Note that the squares of the board will look "squashed" in interlace, so
    I usually recommend sticking with the noninterlaced modes.  This option
    is disabled while a game is in progress.  Miner initially uses a high-res
    noninterlaced screen of your machine's default monitor type.
       key shortcut "M"

    "Sound effects" -- this is a checkmark option which you can switch on or
    off.  Its setting is saved in the high scores file so that your last
    setting remains in force when you start a new game.  When checked, the
    game will accompany your actions with sound effects, if appropriate sound
    sample files are provided.  If no such files are found, the item is
    disabled.  The game becomes silent when the item is unchecked.  Providing
    sound files is explained below.
       key shortcut "Z".

    "Beat the clock" -- a checkmark option which is always off when the
    program is started.  When on, it stops the game as soon as your time is
    no longer good enough to make the high scores list.  If all you're
    interested in is getting an improved high score, you may find that this
    saves time.
       key shortcut "C"

    "Use `?' marks" -- this is another checkmark option which has its setting
    saved in the high scores file.  When checked, clicking the right mouse
    button on a flagged square replaces the flag with a question mark.  When
    not checked, the flag is simply removed.
       key shortcut "?"

    "Win with flags" -- another checkmark option saved in the high scores
    file.  When not checked, the way to win the game is by testing every
    square that does not have a mine.  When checked, the way to win is by
    flagging every square that does have a mine.  These are explained below.
       key shortcut "F"

Each of these has a right-Amiga-key shortcut, as listed above.  The
shortcuts, unlike the right mouse button, work even if the mouse pointer is
over the board.  In the case of the "?" key, a "/" also works, so it is not
necessary to hold down a shift key as well as right-Amiga.  In the case of
the "New", "Pause", and "Quit" commands, you can also use the letters N, P,
and Q without the right-Amiga key, as indicated by the underlines beneath
these letters in the three gadgets.

One feature of this game is that if another window becomes active -- for
instance, if your modem just connected and your telecomm program popped to
the front -- then Miner's "Pause" feature will automatically take effect.
You have to click the mouse on its screen to resume the game, after bringing
Miner back to the front.  This means that if you are interrupted by other
work, it won't just ruin what would otherwise be a good score, though of
course it may break your rhythm or concentration.


	SELECTING BOARD SIZES:
	======================

The "Board" menu contains six checkmarked items for selecting which size of
board to play on, "Beginner", "Intermediate", "Expert", "Custom #1",
"Custom #2", or "Custom #3".  The currently selected board size has a
checkmark next to the menu item.  If you select one of these items, a new
ready-to-play board of that size is created.  As with the "New" gadget, this
can be used to stop a game in the middle.  The six board selection items also
have right-Amiga-key shortcuts: the keys are B, I, E, 1, 2, and 3.

The final item in the "Board" menu is a submenu labeled "Customize".  It is
used to select parameters for the three custom boards.  There is one subitem
for each custom board, labeled in a format like this: "#1  (12 × 12, 28M)".
The numbers in parentheses show the current settings for that board size, in
the same format used in the high scores file: width, height, and number of
mines.  The first number is 1, 2, or 3, indicating which custom board this
subitem will modify.  The "Customize" submenu is disabled while actually
playing a game.  Unlike the other menu options, it has no key shortcuts.

Selecting one of these opens a dialog window with three numeric slider
gadgets.  The first adjusts the width of the board, from 1 to the maximum
that will fit on the screen.  The second adjusts the height likewise.  The
third adjusts the number of mines, with the maximum being half of the total
number of squares in the board.  Each slider has the current number displayed
to its right.  Clicking to the left or right of the movable part of the
slider will decrease or increase the number by one.

As you adjust the width and height, the setting for the number of mines will
change automatically.  For instance, if you double the width, the number of
mines also doubles.  Below the mines slider is a line that tells what percent
of the board's squares will be mined; that number tries to stay constant as
you adjust the size.

At the bottom of the dialog window are "Okay" and "Cancel" buttons.  If you
have the new settings as you wish them, click "Okay".  If you want to go back
to the settings you had before the window was opened, click "Cancel".  If you
change the size (clicking "Okay") and then win a game with the new size, the
previous high scores for that custom board will be forgotten.  They will be
remembered for the old size, however, as long as you have not yet won a game
with the new size.  The high scores list will display the previous board
parameters until they are replaced with a new winning time.


    ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME:
    ==========================

To start playing the game, just click on some squares at random.  Untried
squares are displayed with a "raised" border; the ones you click on are
displayed with "recessed" borders.  The clock starts with the first click.
That first click will never hit a mine, but when you pick squares at random
for later clicks, there is no guarantee.  Sooner or later you will either hit
a mine, in which case you will have to start over, or you will hit a square
that has no mines next to it.  This shows as a blank recessed square.

When you click on one of these, the game automatically checks all the squares
next to it to see how many mines are around each of them, since it is known
that they are all safe to try.  If any of them have no mines around them,
each of their neighbors is tried, and so on.  This continues until it can no
longer find squares without mines next to them.  Because of this effect, one
click can sometimes fill in a rather large irregularly shaped area of the
board, with blank squares in the middle and numbered squares around the
edges.  Any flags that were mistakenly placed on these squares (see next
paragraph) will be cleared away.

Once this happens, you are ready to settle down to serious playing, figuring
out where the bombs are around the filled-in area from the numbers in the
squares around its edges.  When you think you know where a mine is, click the
RIGHT mouse button on the square.  This marks the square with a red flag.
It is possible to play the game without using flags, but it is much easier
and safer to mark known mines with them so you don't click them by mistake.
Every time you flag a square, the number of mines shown on the left side of
the screen decreases, showing you how many are still unaccounted for.  If you
plant too many flags, this number becomes negative, and is shown in red
numerals instead of yellow.

If you click the right mouse button on a flagged square, the action depends
on the setting of the "Use `?' marks" menu item.  If it is not checked, then
a right button click on a flagged square removes the flag.  If it is checked,
the flag is replaced with a question mark, which some players may find useful
as a way of making notes of squares they are unsure of.  Clicking the right
mouse button on a question mark removes it, restoring a blank square.  If
question marks are being used, the way to remove a flag is to click the right
mouse button twice.

If you click the left button on a mined square, you lose the game.  The clock
stops, the screen flashes red briefly, and all of the hidden mines appear.
Any squares which were not mined, but which you had mistakenly put a flag on,
will still have the flag showing; elsewhere the flags will be replaced with
pictures of bombs.  The mine that you stepped on is shown in a recessed
square colored red.

Clicking the left mouse button on a square marked with either a flag or a
question mark has no effect.  The mark makes the square "safe" so you can't
trigger any bomb it contains.  You must remove the flag or question mark to
uncover the square.

If you click either mouse button on a square that has already been clicked
on and is showing a number, then what happens depends on how many flags are
around the square.  If the number of flags is not equal to the number shown
in the square, then any neighboring squares which have not been clicked or
flagged, including question-marked squares, will temporarily show as recessed
until you release the mouse button.  This serves as a simple visual reminder
of which squares are neighbors of the one clicked on.

If the number of flags next to a numbered square is equal to the number
shown, this means -- if you haven't made any mistakes in placing the flags,
that is -- that all of the mines next to that square are in known positions,
and any squares that are not flagged are safe to click on.  Under these
conditions, when you click either button on the numbered square, any squares
next to it which are not flagged, are all automatically tried, as if you had
clicked the left button on each of them in turn.  This feature can save
considerable time.  But if any of the neighboring flags are placed
incorrectly, then at least one mine will be exploded by this process, and you
will lose the game.

You may wonder why I combined two different functions on one mouse action,
depending on the number of surrounding flags, and why I put them on both
buttons instead of just picking one.  The answer is that I tried setting up
this feature in a few different ways, and this is the easiest and, most
importantly, the fastest way to play once you get used to it.  The Windows
version requires you to press both mouse buttons at once to automatically try
neighboring squares, and John Matthews' version uses the right button.  By
offering the same feature in a form that is (in my opinion) less awkward,
Miner may allow you to get faster times while still playing under identical
rules.  And by also handling the other actions too, it won't confuse those
who are used to doing it another way.

Normally, if you uncover the last untried square that does not have a mine
under it, you win.  This is the way to win if the "Win with flags" option is
turned off.  If it is on, the way to win is by placing a flag on every square
that has a mine under it, and no other squares.  In most cases this rule
change affects only the last few moves of the game.  In either case, any
unmarked squares get flagged or numbered automatically.  The clock stops, the
screen flashes various festive colors, and if your score is better than any
of the scores in the high score list for that board size, a window appears
that asks you for your name.  It contains a statement such as (for example)
"You got the second best Beginner score!" and a string gadget where you can
type your name or some other brief comment, up to 21 characters long.  Type
something into the string gadget and press return.  The window also lists the
three previous best scores for that board.  If you get another high score in
the same run of the program, the string gadget will still contain what you
typed into it last time, so you need only press return if you don't want to
change it.  The window will close, and the high score list will appear,
including your new score.  Clicking the left button removes the high score
list.

If the "Beat the clock" option is turned on, and the timer becomes equal to
the time in the third best high score for this board, the game stops.  A
requester appears saying (for instance) "You didn't finish in 74 seconds!
That's the time required to make the high scores list in the Intermediate
category."  The requester has an "Okay" gadget which you have to click to
remove it.  (Any error messages the game displays use a similar requester.)

When a game ends, either in victory or defeat, the board is left on screen
for you to study, showing all the flags and numbers if you won, or if you
lost, all the mines, all flags misplaced on an unmined square, and whatever
numbers you uncovered.  If you want to play another game, use the "New"
gadget or menu item, or select a different board size.


    SOUND EFFECTS:
    ==============

Release 5 of Miner adds optional sound effects, which you can customize.  By
default, it looks for three IFF 8SVX sound sample files in the same directory
that the program is in (PROGDIR:, that is).  The names it looks for are
"Miner.BoomSound", "Miner.WinSound", and "Miner.TestSound".  If it finds a
file by that first name, it plays the sound in it whenever you explode a mine
and lose.  The second sound is played when you win a game.  The third is used
whenever you test an untried square.  Any or all of these files may be
absent.  Any IFF sample up to 128K in size may be used for either sound, or
double that size if you use a stereo sample.  The distribution includes a set
of sample files with these names.  To use them, copy them into whatever
directory you put Miner in.  If you don't want sound, don't copy these files.
The Workbench drawer in the Miner archive is set to display all files, so
these sound files will show as generic "project" icons (or tool icons if you
fail to preserve attributes when unpacking).  To use these files, you can
simply drop these icons into whatever drawer you put Miner in; if it is set
to "Icons only", they will not appear visually there.

Further customization is available with command line or tool type arguments.
Up to six sound files can be specified.  The first three have the defaults
mentioned in the previous paragraph, and the other three default to nothing.
The command template has six keywords, each of which can be used as a tool
type name in the game's Workbench icon: "BoomSound/K,WinSound/K,TestSound/K,
NeighborTestSound/K,RippleSound/K,FlagSound/K".  Follow the keyword with the
full pathname of the IFF sample file to use.  So you can specify sounds on
the command line with, for example: "Miner winsound sys:Music/Samples/
Whoopee", or use the Workbench Information command to give the icon some tool
type lines such as "TESTSOUND=sys:Music/Samples/Tick".  If any specified file
is not found, then that action will be silent, except as noted below.  If
chip memory is tight, audio may be disabled.  The six possible sounds are
used as follows:

    BoomSound           when you detonate a mine
    WinSound            when you win a game
    TestSound           when you click on a square, yielding a number
    NeighborTestSound   when you click on a numbered square with the right
                         number of flags around it, so as to test its
                         neighbors automatically
    RippleSound         when you click a square and it has no bombs next to
                         it, so it automatically fills in a blank area
    FlagSound           when you set or remove a flag or "?" mark

If either RippleSound or NeighborTestSound is not specified, but TestSound
is, then TestSound is used in place of the other sound.  The first two sounds
may be of long duration but the others should be brief -- a "tick" sound, or
something similarly quick.  Those short sounds are all played at half volume,
whereas the first two are played at full volume.


    REACHING THE AUTHOR:
    ====================

I am open to suggestions for improving future releases of the game.  At this
point I have pretty much included every feature I ever thought of adding.
Email paul@paulkienitz.net if you have any feedback or questions.


    HISTORY:
    ========

Release 1:
  - A basic minesweeper clone with three custom board sizes.

Release 2:
  - Added the feature for automatically trying all unflagged neighboring
     squares of a numbered square with the right number of flags around it.
  - The "Beat the clock" option was added.
  - It used to write out a new high scores file every time you exited the
     program; now it skips that if none of the data in the file is different.
  - Added a hack which ensures that the first square you click on to begin a
     game is never mined.  Not that this makes much difference if you have to
     click on four or five to get started.
  - Made menu shortcuts operational when the mouse pointer is over the board.

Release 3:
  - The window that asks for your name when you make a new high score now
     lists the previous high scores for that board.  The string gadget in
     that window now reactivates itself if you click elsewhere in the window.
     It also rejects names consisting only of spaces, and no longer reacts to
     the tab key as if you pressed return.
  - The "New", "Pause", and "Quit" gadgets now have key shortcuts; you can
     just type N, P, or Q without using the right-Amiga key.
  - Fixed a bug: the right-Amiga key shortcuts did not work when the mouse
     was over the board and a game was in progress, and some didn't work
     correctly even when no game was under way.  They all work now.

Release 4:
  - Option to use "?" marks added.
  - "Screen mode" menu option added.
  - There is no longer a requirement for a great big stack.  A drawback of
     this change is that filling in large empty areas may be a bit slower.
  - The About/Pause/High scores requester can now be removed by pressing any
     key, as well as by clicking the left mouse button.
  - Made the color flashes when you hit a bomb or win a game happen
     simultaneously with other actions, so they don't delay anything.  Such
     flashes now involve both the light gray and darker gray areas of the
     screen simultaneously, to make it more emphatic.  The flash when you win
     is longer and fancier.  It also now fixes any error caused by a screen
     "beep" during a flash sequence.
  - Cosmetic error fixed: "Beat the clock" requester was overly tall.

Release 5:
  - Audio added, and startup options to customize it.
  - Options menu added, three items moved there from Game menu, "Sound
     effects" checkmark item added.
  - "Win with flags" option added.
  - Fixed a bug that caused it to open a low-res screen when the high scores
     file was not found.
  - Made the ASL screen mode requester select the correct screen type as the
     default when no type is specified in the high scores file.
  - Corrected a failure to update the display of the number of remaining
     mines when flags get overwritten by an automatically expanded empty
     area.  The count itself would become inaccurate if "?" marks were
     overrun this way.
  - Fixed a small error in the stack-conserving method of filling in large
     empty areas.  The problem did not cause incorrect behavior, only
     inefficiency.

(After release 5 the one change is to update the "reaching the author" section
above in this document.)

My best scores as of release 5 are 5 seconds for Beginner, 40 seconds for
Intermediate, and 135 seconds for Expert.
